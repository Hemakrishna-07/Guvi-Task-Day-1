1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Ans-    Major differences between HTTP1 and HTTP2:
	1. HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual
	2. HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
	3. HTTP2 use one connection for parallelism
	4. HTTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
	5. HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Ans-    Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than 
	primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types 
	contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
	These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, 
	respectively, in the context of an object.

	Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be 
	accessed using these properties associated with them.

	var myCar = new Object();

	myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

	myCar.model = 'Altros';

	myCar.year = 1978;

	myCar.wheels = 2;

	After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
	i.e.
	myCar.year
	Output: 1978

	These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.
	myCar[year]
	Output: 1978
